    // Problem - given a input string s, reverse the order of the words
    // A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space. 

    // Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space

    //Note that s may contain leading or trailing space or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do no include any extra space.

    // we want to pass a string into our function and return a new string that reverses order of our words in our string.

    // spaces will be trimmed only one space will exist between words.
